## Ethan UMS Service Api

#### How to start
Download repo
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Xingyuj/user-management-system.git
```

Go into repo root path simply run (chmod file if no permission)
```bash
    ./start.sh
```
This script will call docker-compose and run DML to insert test data.
After all docker containers start, you should be able to visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger-ui.html to check the system API doc.

#### How to test
Run unit tests
```bash
    mvn test
```
Manually call API by using
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)
- [Swagger](http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger-ui.html)

When doing manul test, one should firstly get a `JWT Authorization Token` from Authentication service by calling `POST` `/authentications` under Authentication Controller. This endpoint needs username and password as parameters. For the convenience of testing, an `admin` user has been initialised into database. Please use this admin user to start testing and create other accounts.
```json
{
  "username":"admin",
  "password":"admin"
}
```

Futhermore, according to requirements, all resource request needs to add `Authorization` as `header`, value is the token string you just get from `POST` `/authentications`. The rest specific parameters that each endpoint needs can be found in [API Doc](http://127.0.0.1:8080/swagger-ui.html)

#### Challenges

* Shiro would prevent swagger resource to be loaded to display api doc, checked on stack overflow, it mentioned to add 'anon' for all swagger resources. But after I added them into the shiro filter its still not working. After researching I add those into application.yml to config and it finnally working. This took me neally an hour to figured out.

* I was tring to config docker-compose to automatically dump DML data into database after containers running. After researching finnally find a solution:
```bash
    docker exec -u postgres xingyu-postgres psql postgres postgres -f docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/dump.
```
